## User Story

AS A marketing agency I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards SO THAT our own site is optimized for
search engines

## Acceptance criteria

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards  

WHEN I view the source code  
THEN I find semantic HTML elements.

THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of
styling and positioning.  

WHEN I view the image elements  
THEN I find accessible alt attributes.  

WHEN I view the heading attributes  
THEN they fall in sequential order.  

WHEN I view the title element  
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title.
